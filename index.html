          Healthy foods are those that provide you with the nutrients you need
          to sustain your body's well-being and retain energy. Water,
          carbohydrates, fat, protein, vitamins, and minerals are the key
          nutrients that make up a healthy, balanced diet.

        <p>
          A food court is an area, usually in a shopping mall, airport or
          railway station, where several catering outlets are grouped together
          with shared seating. The most common type of food court is an area in
          a shopping mall where fast food is sold around a common eating area.

          <p>
            As the number of restaurant food delivery systems has increased, so
            have the logistical challenges of tracking online orders—restaurants
            using delivery services usually must have each service's tablet or
            iPad to receive orders, which then must be transferred into the
            restaurant's own point-of-sales system.To streamline this,
            software-as-a-service companies have emerged to integrate the online
            ordering, billing and dispatching of restaurant food orders.

            Being prompt doesn't mean rushing or hovering, but it does mean
            taking care of customers' needs in an appropriate time frame. Having
            to wait 10 or even five minutes for drink refills, butter, sauce or
            the check can quickly make a good dining experience turn sour.
            Customers can feel awkward when wondering if they should remind
            their servers about the request. They may even eat food without the
            proper condiments or a beverage – something no restaurant owner
            wants, because it can lead to poor reviews.
