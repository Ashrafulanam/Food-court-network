          Healthy foods are those that provide you with the nutrients you need
          to sustain your body's well-being and retain energy. Water,
          carbohydrates, fat, protein, vitamins, and minerals are the key
          nutrients that make up a healthy, balanced diet.

        <p>
          A food court is an area, usually in a shopping mall, airport or
          railway station, where several catering outlets are grouped together
          with shared seating. The most common type of food court is an area in
          a shopping mall where fast food is sold around a common eating area.
